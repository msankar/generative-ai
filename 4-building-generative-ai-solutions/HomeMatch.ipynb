    "1. Generated 10 diverse and realistic real estate listings using an LLM.\n",

    "3. Included functionality where listings are semantically searched based on given buyer preferences. The search returned listings that closely match the input preferences.\n",
    "4. Demonstrated a logical flow where buyer preferences are used to search and then augment the description of real estate listings. The augmentation personalized the listing without changing factual information.\n",
    "5. Utilized an LLM to generate personalized descriptions for the real estate listings based on buyer preferences. The descriptions were unique, appealing, and tailored to the preferences provided.\n",
    "6. We tested for various scenarios."
